I'm playing with [Twelvety](https://github.com/jeff4/twelvety) which is an [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev) starter originally created by [Greg Ives](https://github.com/gregives/Twelvety). Items to explore:

- Testing git local and remote
- Creation of new layout types
- Handling of images and overall image pipeline
- adding a footer

<!-- Markdown images will automatically use the responsive picture shortcode -->
