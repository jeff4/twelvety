I'm playing with Twelvety which is an [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev) starter originally created by [Greg Ives](https://gregives.co.uk). It includes:

- Testing git local and remote
- Component architecture
- CSS pipeline using Sass, PostCSS and CleanCSS
- JS pipeline using Browserify, Babel and Uglify
- Page-specific CSS and JS
- Inline critical CSS and defer non-critical CSS
- Minified HTML, CSS and JS
- Responsive picture shortcode **with AVIF and WebP support**
- Content-hash of assets

<!-- Markdown images will automatically use the responsive picture shortcode -->
