# Twelvety modified

[Twelvety](https://github.com/gregives/Twelvety) is an [Eleventy starter](https://www.11ty.dev) for building fast, modern websites. You can reference the original README at the [main Twelvety repo](https://github.com/gregives/Twelvety#readme).

I've edited this starter for my own purposes. Thanks for giving me a solid foundation, [Greg Ives](https://github.com/gregives)!
